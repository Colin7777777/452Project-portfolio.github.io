 <div class="calligraphy">
    <p>According to industry sources, Apple is secretly developing an augmented reality glasses called "iGlass", and for the first time disclosed a set of prototype design drawings. It is reported that iGlass will integrate cutting-edge optical display technology and powerful computing power, so that users can overlay digital information on the basis of the real world, so as to achieve mixed reality applications. The glasses are expected to integrate with Apple's own ARKit platform to create a rich ecosystem and further broaden the application prospects of many fields, from gaming and entertainment to education and healthcare. As iGlass progresses, Apple may be quietly laying out the next generation of computing platforms to redefine the way people live and work.</p>
